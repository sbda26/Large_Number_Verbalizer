  This program will take just about any conceivable gargantuan number you can come up with, that is, a number where you don’t know what 'illion' it is, and it will tell you.
  <br><br>
  <em>Example:</em> if you type in '79228162514264337593543950335', you will get '79 octillion, 228 septillion, 162 sextillion, 514 quintillion, 264 quadrillion, 337 trillion, 593 billion, 543 million, 950 thousand, 335.'
  <br><br>
  It will also approximate the number for you in scientific notation (i.e. the above number will appear as 7.92 x 10 to the 28th power).
  <br><br>
  It can also represent the number for you in the old long scale (i.e., the above number would read as '79 quadrilliard, 228 quadrillion, 162 trilliard, 514 trillion, 264 billiard, 337 billion, 593 milliard, 543 million, 950 thousand, 335').
  <br><br>
  It also will verbalize various large constants (i.e. 'googol' = '10 duotrigintillion') and the large numbers that occur with light-distances.
  <br><br>
  And - you can enter any 'illion' you want and get its numeric representation.
